Pink Pony Express is a multi-disciplinary design collective, based in The Netherlands. Their work is inspired by how government and society interface with one another – and the friction this can create.
The collective will present two projects about hacking in public space, one analog and one digital. 
For the project Spuiten of Hakken, the collective works together with a master stone carver to immortalise graffiti. Their project Raduga is an algorithm that predicts rainbows over Russian territories, in response to Putin's dictatorial regime.
