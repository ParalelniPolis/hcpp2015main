Pink Pony Express is a design collective from Amsterdam. Projects of Ponnies are concerned in conflict or friction environments. Following a period of long-term research that includes living and working on these locations, they reformulate the experience in a visual form that helps redefine the situation, creates a shift in the current perspective and often provokes positive change.
