Monopolies are no guarantees of quality. The same is true for monopolies for the provision of justice. A justice system has in the past existed even without the state and was generally superior to state justice. People just don't think so, because they've been raised not to think so. This presentation will explain the practical differences between state and market-provided justice, and go through real examples, including the provision of justice in cyberspace.
