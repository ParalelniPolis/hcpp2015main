Monopolies are no guarantee of quality. And as we know, the truth is  usually just the opposite. The same is true for monopolies on the provision of justice. Justice without the state has always existed, and is generally superior  to state justice. People just don't think so, because they've been  trained not to think so. This presentation will explain the practical differences between state and market-provided justice, and go through real examples, including the provision of justice in cyberspace.
