Philipp Kalwies is an entrepreneur from Hamburg, living in Berlin. As an anarcho-capitalist from birth, yearning for liberty, he always wanted to build his own anarchistic "state". When he incidentally found Seasteading he was immediately in favor of it and organized a talk by the Seasteading Institute’s founder Patri Friedman in Hamburg in 2009. In 2010 he organized the so far largest libertarian conference in Germany, the ‘Große Freiheit 01’, at which Patri Friedman gave a talk about the Seasteading Institute and its mission. Philipp has written different articles for libertarian magazines and also gave several talks about Seasteading at different opportunities like the annual academy of the high IQ society Mensa in Germany (MinD-Akademie) in 2010 and 2011 of which he is a member. In January 2014 he founded one of the most innovative FinTech companies in Germany: Decimo GmbH, which offers factoring solutions for freelancers. He is also a specialist for Quantified Self and founder of the Quantified Self meetup group in Hamburg.
