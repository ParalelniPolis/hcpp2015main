BIO: Pavol Rusnak, also known as stick, is an all-around hacker, open-source enthusiast and technology geek. He’s been involved in open development of various software and hardware projects since he can remember and no technical challenge is big enough for him. When he’s not currently investigating some emerging technologies or digging into hard core cryptography, he’s probably trying to bring some new-media interactiveart projects to life.

PRESENTATION:The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster,
safer, and more open.
