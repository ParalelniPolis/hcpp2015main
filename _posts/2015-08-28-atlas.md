During the lecture we will revisit the age-old notion of money and fungibility to determine: How important is fungibility? How can we quantify it? On this basis, we will explore whether Bitcoin is on the road to a fungibility collapse and what protective measures can be taken.

Kristov worked on the evaluation of network and application security for both beginner start-ups developing bitcoin wallets, but also for the world's largest corporations. Kristov revealed critical vulnerabilities in the world's most popular bitcoin service - the tool SharedCoin from Blockchain.info. He is a popular speaker and a distinguished personality at the New York Bitcoin scene.
