Lyn Ulbricht is the mother of Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the Silk Road website. As a result of his involvement, Ross received a double life sentence without parole for all non-violent charges. Since Ross was arrested Lyn has worked to bring awareness to the case and raise funds for Ross’s defense through www.FreeRoss.org, media interviews, public appearances and other efforts. Lyn has witnessed how the U.S. government prosecutes citizens; suppresses evidence; and violates the Constitution. She has learned how the precedent set with this case threatens internet freedom and expands government power. She believes it is a story that needs to be told.
