Lyn has become a full-time activist since her son Ross, the alleged creator of Silk Road, an anonymous online marketplace operated as a Tor hidden service, was arrested by the US security services. She has been working around the clock to help Ross by running the FREE ROSS ULBRICHT fund and raising various issues concerning freedom of internet which surrounded the trial which led to his life sentence.

Lyn Ulbricht is the mother of Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the Silk Road website. As a result of his involvement, Ross received a double life sentence without parole for all non-violent charges. Since Ross was arrested Lyn has worked to bring awareness to the case and raise funds for Ross’s defense through www.FreeRoss.org, media interviews, public appearances and other efforts. Lyn has witnessed how the U.S. government prosecutes citizens; suppresses evidence; and violates the Constitution. She has learned how the precedent set with this case threatens internet freedom and expands government power. She believes it is a story that needs to be told.
